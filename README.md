# Asterisk
Files for people who are not interested in compiling Chan Dongle on their own.
Compiled for Asterisk 18.10.0 from Ubuntu Server repository.
Modded file with replaced hash will bypass integrity control in this Asterisk release.

If you are using different release, and are sure, that there will be no conflicts due to
age, you can replace hash on your own. Manual here:
